# game_pygame_piu

The very first development on Python. If I may say so. :-)
Wrote code that works. At the moment I understand that it needs refactoring.

Technology stack:
-Python 3.8.*;
-Package installer -PIP;
-Pygame lib;
-IDE - PyCharm;
-PEP8.

Description:
2D game . Shooter. Space. Keeping statistics without saving.

Keyboard controls: 
-left key- to go left;
-right key- to move to the right;
-space - jump;
-f - shot (limited quantity);
-i - refresh the boss;
-q - exit.
